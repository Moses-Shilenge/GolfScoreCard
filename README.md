# GolfScoreCard

The application is designed and built to calculate golf scores using the Stroke Play method for version 1.0

## Golf terms
* **Par:** number of expected shots for a hole.
* **Index:** represents the level of difficulty of the hole ranging from 1 being the hardest to 18 the easiest.
* **Handicap:** The number shots credited for playing skill or ability in the game. The lower the handicap the more experienced the player.

Moving on I will be implementing stableford points (par scoring).
### Points are awarded as follows:
* on par = 2 points
* 1 over the par = 1 point
* 2 over the par = 0 points

* 1 under par = 3 points
* 2 under par = 4 points

I am also new to Golf, so to make life easier I've added the two links which helped me understand how this should work:
