# GolfScoreCard

The application can now calculate the golf score using stroke play method and Stable Ford points methods.
### The application has the following views:
* Score board (Create page)
  * I didn't complicate the create function as of yet, on this form, you can add a **players name** and **score** for each **hole**. 
* Previous Scores (View page)
  * The default view is the stroke play scores. The list is sorted by **date** and each row can be **updated** and **deleted**
  * Below the table I've added two buttons, one navigates you the **create page** and the second navigates you to the **Stable Ford Score view**, there's no consistency in the style as I am still experimenting with the views.
* Edit and Delete views
  * pretty much self explanatory.
  
## Golf terms
* **Par:** number of expected shots for a hole.
* **Index:** represents the level of difficulty of the hole ranging from 1 being the hardest to 18 the easiest.
* **Handicap:** The number shots credited for playing skill or ability in the game. The lower the handicap the more experienced the player.

Moving on I will be implementing stableford points (par scoring).
### Points are awarded as follows:
* on par = 2 points
* 1 over the par = 1 point
* 2 over the par = 0 points

* 1 under par = 3 points
* 2 under par = 4 points

I am also new to Golf, so to make life easier I've added the two links which helped me understand how this should work:

## Setup
I've added a Resource folder containing a database backup, please use this when running the project. I've added the Tees here and the Migration doesn't insert these values, I'll include this in my next commit. 

### You can restore the database from the file in the resource folder.
